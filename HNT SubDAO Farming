## Summary
Given Helium’s existing SubDAO structure, I believe there’s a significant opportunity to enable a SubDAO farming model to financially benefit HNT holders and its participants. 
Specifically, integrating SubDAO farming yields with HNT could enable users to select from various SubDAO tokens — e.g. MOBILE, IOT, ENERGY, etc. — to receive as their yield... 
this would marry and create a way to merge DePIN x DeFi. This adaptation would align with Helium's vision of becoming the network of networks in DePIN but also enhance the economic
utility and value of HNT as a dynamic, yield-bearing, and stronger programmatic treasury asset.

## Motivation

- Why are we doing this? To distribute the ownership of each SubDAO as widely as possible.
To ensure that SubDAO creation drives value to the Helium network in the form of:
- HNT demand
- Governance participation
- To incentivize talented individuals to work to make each SubDAO a success.
- What use cases does it support? DeFi 
- What problems does it solve? Idle, unproductive state of HNT and lack of token holder engagement.
- What is the expected outcome? Distribute SubDAO tokens widely via token farming initiatives.

## Stakeholders

- Who is affected by this HIP? Token Holders
- How are we soliciting feedback on this HIP from these stakeholders? Feedback on X

## Drawbacks

- Why should we _not_ do this? HNT was intended for DePIN, not DeFi
- What problems could occur if we do this? Dilution of focus

## Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
Existing SubDAO model makes it relatively simple to integrate. 
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
Vanilla HNT Staking could be considered as an alternative, but given HNT's limited supply, it would be more strategic to use these resources to incentivize growth 
in DePIN and use SubDAOs for distribution to reward HNT holders.

## Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the HIP process before this gets merged? The technical specifications, economic impact, community consensus
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature? Functionality and UI, performance optimisation, security enhancements, 
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HIP that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this HIP? The % of SubDAO token issuance that is allocated to the HNT delegator per year.

## Deployment Impact

Describe how this design will be deployed and any potential impact it may have on current users of
this project.

- How will current users be impacted?
- How will existing documentation/knowledge base need to be supported? Any content to change at
  <http://docs.helium.com>?
- Is this backwards compatible? Can this HIP be undone?
  - If not, what is the procedure to migrate?

## Success Metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design? Are any new ETL reports needed to
measure the success?

- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?
- What should we measure to prove an improvement in stability?
- What should we measure to prove a reduction in complexity?
- What should we measure to prove an acceptance of this by its users?
